    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bake a chicken that's tender and juicy with this simple, 5-ingredient recipe <br>
           for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Adding just a bit of chicken broth to <br>
           the pan drippings creates a tasty pan sauce that adds extra flavour.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and<br>
                sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink<br>
                in the centre and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer<br>
                inserted into the centre should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken to a plate</li>
            <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with <br>
                a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits,<br>
                but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
            <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
