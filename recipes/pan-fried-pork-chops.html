    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Few things are as easy to prepare as these pan-fried boneless pork chops.<br>
       They take only minutes to prepare! The emphasis is on the great flavor of pork,<br>
       so if you'd like more seasoning, go for it. For perfectly done chops,<br>
       always use a meat thermometer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless pork chops, 3/4-inch thick</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not pat chops dry, so seasonings and flour will stick.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper,<br>
                then sprinkle with flour on both sides. Use the back of<br>
                a spoon to distribute the flour over the entire surface.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until it shimmers.<br>
                Carefully add pork chops and pan fry until brown, about 4 minutes.<br>
                Do not disturb the chops until ready to turn.</li>
            <li>When you see the edges of the chops turn brown, turn, and<br>
                pan fry the other side until no longer pink on the inside and brown<br>
                on the outside, an additional 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer<br>
                inserted into the centre should read 145 degrees F (63 degress C). Reduce<br>
                the heat, if they are browning too quickly. Serve warm.</li>
